                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Scientists have only captured this type of creature during the night in the extremely cold regions within the polar circles. After a series of observational experiments in the laboratory, scientists discovered that it is extremely averse to sunlight and high temperatures, therefore it can only be active during the cold nights. Additionally, this amphibious creature follows strict survival rules in water. They need to capture a certain type of special nutritional cell in the water to sustain life, but another type of bacteria present in the water is deadly poison to them. Therefore, in the natural environment, to survive, these creatures often choose to hide in the water during the day to avoid sunlight and temperature while striving to obtain the necessary nutritional cells; at night, they mostly leave the water to be active in the air. When conditions allow, they will avoid the possibility of accidentally coming into contact with the "poison" in the water on their own. The habitat diversity caused by their survival characteristics is also one of the reasons why scientists have difficulty capturing these creatures.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>According to current scientific research findings, this is a species that does not typically live in groups. In the natural environment, it is often only possible to capture individual specimens of this creature. Based on existing research results, it is clear that this is a variant species of a small flying organism that has undergone mutations due to genetic infection or the influence of extreme environmental conditions. Consequently, its survival conditions are relatively harsh, which also makes it more difficult for scientists to observe and study it in the laboratory. The method and conditions of its reproduction are not yet clear.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>It has six complete wings in the air, distributed on both sides of its body, resembling the appearance of primitive butterflies; in water, its wings fold and retract into the body, and it grows a tail similar to that of primitive fish to help it move freely in water. At the same time, due to continuous contact with various bacteria in the water and resulting chemical reactions, the color of its skin surface keeps changing.</p>

                "Flutterfin" is a creature with a new genetic combination discovered and captured in the polar regions. Through laboratory observation and research, it has been determined to possess photophobia, a preference for cold, and the ability to change form between aquatic and terrestrial environments. The nutritional cells it requires for survival and the bacteria that can cause its death are both found exclusively in water. Due to its harsh living conditions, the number of samples scientists can study is limited. It is speculated that "Flutterfin" is likely a new species that emerged from the mutation resulting from the genetic fusion of some type of flying creature and fish, driven by extreme environmental changes.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>  After capturing this creature, scientists simulated its diverse living environments in the laboratory: a low-temperature experimental chamber without sunlight. The chamber contains both air and automatically fluctuating tides. By placing one flutterfin in the experimental chamber and using special methods to control its movement and survival status, they observed and summarized its rules of survival.
